# Medical Cost Prediction with SHAP Visualization

This project is an end-to-end pipeline that predicts medical costs using machine learning and provides SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations to explain the model‚Äôs predictions. It leverages a trained XGBoost model and a preprocessor pipeline to predict healthcare expenses based on various features like age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

## Features
- **Medical Cost Prediction**: The model predicts the medical cost (`charges`) for each individual in the dataset based on their health and personal information.
- **SHAP Visualizations**: Displays feature importance, beeswarm plots, and waterfall plots to explain how the model makes predictions.
- **Custom Prediction**: Users can input custom data (e.g., age, BMI, smoking status) to get real-time predictions along with explanation visualizations.
- **Prediction Log**: Predictions are logged to a CSV file for analysis and record-keeping.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (3.7+)
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web app.
- **XGBoost**: Machine learning model for predicting medical costs.
- **SHAP**: For interpreting and explaining the predictions.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the model and preprocessor.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.

## Requirements
To run the app locally, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-cost-prediction.git
   cd medical-cost-prediction



How to Use
Upload a CSV or Use Default Data: In the sidebar, you can either upload a custom dataset (CSV) or use the default medical dataset (medical.csv) to visualize predictions.

Custom Predictions: Enter personal information (age, sex, BMI, smoking status, etc.) in the custom input section to get a prediction for that individual‚Äôs medical costs.

SHAP Explanation: After making predictions, the app will display SHAP visualizations like feature importance, beeswarm plots, and waterfall plots to explain how the model arrived at the prediction.

Save Predictions: Every prediction made through the app is saved in logs/custom_predictions_log.csv for future analysis.
