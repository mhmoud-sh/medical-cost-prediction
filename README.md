## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

- Trained XGBoost Regressor to predict `charges` using real-world medical cost dataset.
- SHAP Explainability: Global and Local feature importance visualized.
- Beeswarm and Waterfall plots for insights into feature contributions.
- Custom input form to simulate predictions with your own data.
- Predictions automatically logged to a CSV file with timestamp.
- Download SHAP explanation plot as PNG.
